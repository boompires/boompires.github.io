      <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
      <p>
        HTML is the structure of your webpage kind of like the skeleton since
        our skeleton is the structure of our body. HTML is made up of tags. A
        tag is always surrounded by < and > which are the greater and less than
        signs you use in math. All the HTML in your webpage is wrapped in an
        html tag which looks like this: < html >. Now, what I just showed you is
        an opening tag which goes at the beginning of the content inside your
        tag. The closing tag is the same thing but goes after the content and
        has an extra slash which looks like this: < /html >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another tag is the head tag. It looks like this: < head >. The closing
        tag looks like this: &lt;/head&gt;. You usually put a title tag inside
        the head tag. The opening title tag looks like this: &lt;title&gt;. The
        closing title tag looks like this: &lt;/title&gt;. Whatever text you put
        in the title tag is what appears in the tab at the top of your browser.
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>Here is a list of some HTML tags and what they do:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            &lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt; the h1 tag creates the biggeset size heading
          </li>
          <li>
            You go up to h7 with the heading tags h1 being the biggest and h7
            being the smallest.
          </li>
          <li>P tags</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
